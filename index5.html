<!--Intro-->
      My name is Victoria Ebner and I am a junior journalism major at the University of
        Maryland. I currently work for UMD's independent student newspaper, The Diamondback </span>, where
        I cover political advocacy and social issues. I am interested in politics, social justice,
        activism, LGBTQIA+ topics and everything in between. I'm also in the Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority here at Maryland.
        Right now, I interested in design and use of illustration in journalism, as well as coding. I hope to be able to execute those skills when I enter the work force next year.
